# HOT Export server

This repo has the version 1 code which has now been superseded. **The live site at http://export.hotosm.org is now running code from the new version 2 repo: https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool2** however (for a while at least) this code is still runnning at http://old-export.hotosm.org/

The HOT export server allows you to create custom OpenStreetMap exports for various regions. You can specify an area of interest and a list of features (OpenStreetMap tags) for the export. A current OpenStreetMap data extract for that area in various data formats is then created for you within minutes
